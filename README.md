# HeritageArchiveFHE

**HeritageArchiveFHE** is a secure platform for storing, analyzing, and researching architectural heritage digital models while preserving the confidentiality of sensitive data. Using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, researchers can perform measurements and structural analysis on encrypted 3D point clouds and BIM models without accessing raw data, safeguarding cultural heritage assets.

---

## Project Background

Architectural heritage preservation involves challenges related to digitization and research:

- **Data sensitivity:** Digital scans and BIM models of historic buildings contain proprietary or sensitive information about cultural sites.  
- **Limited access:** Uncontrolled access to these models risks misuse or alteration.  
- **Analytical needs:** Researchers require precise measurements, comparisons, and structural analysis to inform restoration or conservation projects.  

Traditional digital archives either restrict access or expose raw models, limiting collaboration. HeritageArchiveFHE enables secure computation while maintaining full confidentiality.

## Why FHE Matters

Fully Homomorphic Encryption is central to HeritageArchiveFHE because it allows:

1. **Encrypted measurements:** Researchers can measure distances, volumes, and surfaces without decrypting models.  
2. **Secure structural analysis:** Load-bearing, stress simulations, and material assessments are performed on encrypted data.  
3. **Protected digital archives:** Raw 3D and BIM files never leave the encrypted state, reducing the risk of data leaks.  
4. **Collaborative research:** Multiple parties can contribute analyses while keeping proprietary models confidential.  

FHE ensures that sensitive architectural data is never exposed while still supporting rigorous research.
